    "### A Perceptron is a single neuron model that was a precursor to larger neural networks. It is a field of study that investigates how simple models of biological brains can be used to solve difficult computational tasks like the predictive modeling tasks we see in machine learning. The goal is not to create realistic models of the brain, but instead to develop robust algorithms and data structures that we can use to model difficult problems."

    "### You may be familiar with linear regression, in which case the weights on the inputs are very much like the coefficients used in a regression equation. Like linear regression, each neuron also has a bias which can be thought of as an input that always has the value 1.0 and it too must be weighted. For example, a neuron may have two inputs in which case it requires three weights. One for each input and one for the bias."

    "### Weights are often initialized to small random values, such as values in the range 0 to 0.3, although more complex initialization schemes can be used. Like linear regression, larger weights indicate increased complexity and fragility of the model. It is desirable to keep weights in the network small and regularization techniques can be used."

    "### The weighted inputs are summed and passed through an activation function, sometimes called a transfer function. An activation function is a simple mapping of summed weighted input to the output of the neuron. It is called an activation function because it governs the threshold at which the neuron is activated and the strength of the output signal. Historically simple step activation functions were used where if the summed input was above a threshold, for example 0.5, then the neuron would output a value of 1.0, otherwise it would output a 0.0."
