    "### A Perceptron is a single neuron model that was a precursor to larger neural networks. It is a field of study that investigates how simple models of biological brains can be used to solve difficult computational tasks like the predictive modeling tasks we see in machine learning. The goal is not to create realistic models of the brain, but instead to develop robust algorithms and data structures that we can use to model difficult problems."

    "### You may be familiar with linear regression, in which case the weights on the inputs are very much like the coefficients used in a regression equation. Like linear regression, each neuron also has a bias which can be thought of as an input that always has the value 1.0 and it too must be weighted. For example, a neuron may have two inputs in which case it requires three weights. One for each input and one for the bias."

    "### Weights are often initialized to small random values, such as values in the range 0 to 0.3, although more complex initialization schemes can be used. Like linear regression, larger weights indicate increased complexity and fragility of the model. It is desirable to keep weights in the network small and regularization techniques can be used."
