    "* The filters are essentially the neurons of the layer. They have both weighted inputs and generate an output value like a neuron. The input size is a fixed square called a patch or a receptive field. If the convolutional layer is an input layer, then the input patch will be pixel values. If they deeper in the network architecture, then the convolutional layer will take input from a feature map from the previous layer."

    "* The feature map is the output of one filter applied to the previous layer. A given filter is drawn across the entire previous layer, moved one pixel at a time. Each position results in an activation of the neuron and the output is collected in the feature map.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The distance that filter is moved across the input from the previous layer each activation is referred to as the stride. If the size of the previous layer is not cleanly divisible by the size of the filters receptive field and the size of the stride then it is possible for the receptive field to attempt to read oâ†µ the edge of the input feature map. In this case, techniques like zero padding can be used to invent mock inputs with zero values for the receptive field to read."

    "* The pooling layers down-sample the previous layers feature map. Pooling layers follow a sequence of one or more convolutional layers and are intended to consolidate the features learned and expressed in the previous layers feature map. As such, pooling may be consider a technique to compress or generalize feature representations and generally reduce the overfitting of the training data by the model."

    "* Fully connected layers are the normal flat feedforward neural network layer. These layers may have a nonlinear activation function or a softmax activation in order to output probabilities of class predictions. Fully connected layers are used at the end of the network after feature extraction and consolidation has been performed by the convolutional and pooling layers. They are used to create final nonlinear combinations of features and for making predictions by the network."
