    "### A Perceptron is a single neuron model that was a precursor to larger neural networks. It is a field of study that investigates how simple models of biological brains can be used to solve difficult computational tasks like the predictive modeling tasks we see in machine learning. The goal is not to create realistic models of the brain, but instead to develop robust algorithms and data structures that we can use to model difficult problems."

Like linear regression, each neuron also has a bias which can be thought of as an input that always has the value 1.0 and it too must be weighted. For example, a neuron may have two inputs in which case it requires three weights. One for each input and one for the bias."

Like linear regression, larger weights indicate increased complexity and fragility of the model. It is desirable to keep weights in the network small and regularization techniques can be used."

An activation function is a simple mapping of summed weighted input to the output of the neuron. It is called an activation function because it governs the threshold at which the neuron is activated and the strength of the output signal. Historically simple step activation functions were used where if the summed input was above a threshold, for example 0.5, then the neuron would output a value of 1.0, otherwise it would output a 0.0."

More recently the rectifier activation function has been shown to provide better results."

They are deep because they would have been unimaginably slow to train historically, but may take seconds or minutes to train using modern techniques and hardware."

This can be turned into a crisp class value by using a threshold of 0.5 and snap values less than the threshold to 0 otherwise to 1.\n",

In this case a softmax activation function may be used to output a probability of the network predicting each of the class values. Selecting the output with the highest probability can be used to produce a crisp class classification value."

    "### The classical and still preferred training algorithm for neural networks is called stochastic gradient descent. This is where one row of data is exposed to the network at a time as input. The network processes the input upward activating neurons as it goes to finally produce an output value. This is called a forward pass on the network. It is the type of pass that is also used after the network is trained in order to make predictions on new data. The output of the network is compared to the expected output and an error is calculated. This error is then propagated back through the network, one layer at a time, and the weights are updated according to the amount that they contributed to the error."

This is called batch learning and is often more stable.Because datasets are so large and because of computational efficiencies, the size of the batch, the number of examples the network is shown before an update is often reduced to a small number, such as tens or hundreds of examples. The amount that weights are updated is controlled by a configuration parameter called the learning rate. It is also called the step size and controls the step or change made to network weights for a given error. Often small learning rates are used such as 0.1 or 0.01 or smaller. The update equation can be complemented with additional configuration terms that you can set.\n",
