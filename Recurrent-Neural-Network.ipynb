    "### When Back propagation is used in very deep neural networks and in unrolled recurrent neural networks, the gradients that are calculated in order to update the weights can become unstable. They can become very large numbers called exploding gradients or very small numbers called the vanishing gradient problem. These large numbers in turn are used to update the weights in the network, making training unstable and the network unreliable."

As such it can be used to create large (stacked) recurrent networks, that in turn can be used to address di\u0000cult sequence problems in machine learning and achieve state-of-the-art results. Instead of neurons, LSTM networks have memory blocks that are connected into layers."
